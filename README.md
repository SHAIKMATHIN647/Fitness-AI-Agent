# FitnessBuddy AI Agent

## Problem Statement
In today’s fast-paced world, many people find it challenging to maintain a healthy lifestyle due to the absence of personalized guidance, limited time, and inconsistent motivation. Traditional fitness solutions often involve costly subscriptions, in-person consultations, or rigid schedules that fail to adapt to individual preferences and daily routines.  
There is a growing demand for an accessible, friendly, and intelligent virtual assistant that can offer on-demand fitness advice, healthy lifestyle tips, and basic nutrition guidance—personalized to each user and available anytime.

## Proposed Solution
Introducing **FitnessBuddy AI Agent**, powered by IBM Watsonx and Granite foundation models.  
This conversational agent uses natural language understanding and Agentic AI capabilities to act as a virtual personal fitness coach. It delivers home workout recommendations, healthy meal plans, motivational support, and gracefully handles off-topic queries—helping users stay consistent with their fitness goals through natural, interactive conversations.
